# HospitalDatabaseGenerator
Generates a hospital database. Generates SQL Code using python


Contains a few text files that have names of people, places etc. and they are loaded into python and randomly generate different details about each patient. These are combined in order to build a nice database containing information about the patient, doctors, drugs, and appointments.

I made this as a joke in my first semester, where in the assingment guidelines we were incorrectly given the task of creating a database with at least a 1000 patients. This helped me automate all that and we were done with the project before the teacher was able to rectify that we do not need such a high number of data points.
